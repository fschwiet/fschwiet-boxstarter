
This project contains the boxstarter packages I use for machine initialization.  Boxstarter [https://boxstarter.codeplex.com/] is a tool that extends Chocolatey to make setting up new Windows machines repeatable and reliable.

To run one of these the packages, open http://boxstarter.org/package/<packageName> from internet explorer.
